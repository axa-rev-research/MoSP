= Mobile Security & Privacy Simulaor =

The Mobile Security & Privacy (MoSP) Simulator has been originated at the 
Distributed Computing & Security Group at Leibniz Universitaet Hannover, 
Germany. <http://www.dcsec.uni-hannover.de/>

The MoSP simulator has been designed for research in the field of security 
and privacy of modern mobile devices. It is meant for the evaluation of 
mobile security and privacy issues as well as corresponding solutions. 

The basic version has been built by Florian Ludwig and Philipp Tute. 
Ongiong work has been done by Benjamin Henne and Philipp Tute.
Any user is invited to use to simulator to build his own simulations. 
We are pleased about any extension of the core features resulting from 
new simulation requirements.

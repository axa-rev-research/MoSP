To generate reproducable simulation results, the programmer/user
of a MoSP simulation has to adhere some basic rules.

1) Always use reproducable random numbers and random selections
   by using a simulation's base random number generator and initial seed. 
   The generator can be used to generate numbers, to make choices,
   or to seed other sub-ordinate random generators.
   See random.pdf for random generators in the MoSP simulator.
   Person._random is seeded by Simulation.random for example.

2) Use Phython's built-in unordered dicts with caution.
   "It is best to think of a dictionary as an unordered set of key: value pairs" [1]
   "The only thing about dictionary ordering you can rely on is that the order 
    will remain the same if there are no modifications to the dictionary; 
    e.g., iterating over a dictionary twice without modifying it will result 
    in the same sequence of keys. However, though the order of Python 
    dictionaries is deterministic, it can be influenced by factors such 
    as the order of insertions and removals, so equal dictionaries can 
    end up with different orderings." [2]
    Maybe always use sorted().

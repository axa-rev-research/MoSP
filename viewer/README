MoSP-Simulation Viewer
(pyglet-based)

Starting the Viewer:
    The Viewer can be started without a running simulation. In this case it just works as a viewer for OpenStreetMap.

    For starting the player with a simulation to display:
        1. Start a simulation using the SocketPlayerMonitor. It will then wait for a Viewer to connect.
        2a. When running the simulation on another computer the host must be changed accordingly when initializing the player.
        2b. When running the simulation on a different port than default (60001), this must be changed when initializing the player, too.
        3. Start the player. Usually this can be done by simply running player.py

Controls for the player:
    Move the map using the mouse or arrow-keys.

    Zoom by using the mouse-wheel, +/- keys or CTRL+UP/DOWN

    Other keys:
        CTRL+F - toggle fullscreen
        CTRL+S - take screenshot
        F      - toggle FPS in lower left corner
        Q/ESC  - quit the Viewer
        Space  - return to last position the player was centered on

Recording a video:
    There is no direct way for recording a video. You can however try this little workaround:

    Schedule taking screenshots with the desired refreshrate (here 1/60.0) by calling

        pyglet.clock.schedule_interval(Player.take_screenshot, 1/60.0)

    and create a video using the resulting images.
    NOTE: This is just a suggestion without any guarantee of actually working. It has not been testet and may result in a large loss of performance!
    
    For a nicer look it might be a good idea to disable drawing the bounding box when initializing the SocketPlayerMonitor (for example by setting monitor.draw_bb to False before starting the simulation).
